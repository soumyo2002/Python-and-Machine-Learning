1)You will be seeing this print function very frequently in python programming. It helps us to see what exactly is happening in our code.
Try to run the next lines of code and see what happens next:We use print to display data on screen. Example: print("Hello World!")

2)Understanding variables is very important in any programming language they are used all the time in python. 
Using variables in place of direct numbers have many advantages. 
Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
here in this example below the variable name is month, the equal sign is the assignment operator and the value of the variable is 12.
Example:
month=12;

3)We require variables so that we can represent the data and also change it later if needed.
